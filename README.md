# Cellular Automaton
A collection of [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) programs, written in C++ mostly for learning/exercises.

## Quick start
Most (if not all) programs can be built with *majority of* C++ compilers so there's nothing special here.

## Instructions
### GameOfLife: 
- `'e'` -> Exit
- `'r'` -> Restart (create new random board)
- `Any other key` -> One step forward in 'Simulation'

### Rule101/Rule30/LangstonsAnt
- Nothing special, just build and run
